# kobra3v2_cura_conf
My anycubic Kobra 3 v2 cura config

### This config will work, but the printer will complain about missing instructions (error 10133)

I am not sure why this error persists, as the top of the file looks very similar to the ones generated by the anycubic slicer, but it will still work nonetheless
